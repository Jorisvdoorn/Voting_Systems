# Voting_Systems
This repository serves 3 purposes:
1. Practicing creating dashboards in R using Shiny
2. Demonstrating how different voting systems influence voting outcomes, inspired by the following video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoAnYQZrNrQ&t=
3. Developing a tool that can determine the next book my philosophy reading group wants to read, based on everyones ranking of all possible books in the selection.
